# AADL to AltaRica Translator

This experimental OSATE feature takes an AADL instance model with EMV2 annex
subclauses and creates an AltaRica (version 3) model from it.

The AltaRica model can be imported into OpenAltaRica for further analysis.

This is an experimental feature which may or may not be supported in the future.
